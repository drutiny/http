description: |
    [Referrer Policy](https://scotthelme.co.uk/a-new-security-header-referrer-policy/) is
    a header that allows a site to control how much information the browser
    includes with navigations away from a document and should be set by all sites.
remediation: |
  There are number of methods to enable Referrer-Policy. The best option will depend on what
  best suits your project implementation:
    - Install the [HTTP Response Headers](https://www.drupal.org/project/seckit) module and set Referrer-Policy.
    - If you're using an edge CDN/WAF, consult your provider to see if they support Referrer-Policy.
    - Manually manipulate your `.htaccess` file to the Referrer-Policy header.

  ### Referrer Policy Values
  - If you are happy for other sites to see referrer data from your site, use `no-referrer-when-downgrade`. This requires HTTPS.
  - If you don't want to share referrer information use `strict-origin`
  - If you don't want to share any referrer information use `no-referrer`
success: "Referrer-Policy header found in HTTP response: `{{header_value}}`."
failure: No Referrer-Policy header found in response.
