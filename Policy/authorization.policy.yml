title: "HTTP Authorization Disabled"
class: \Drutiny\Http\Audit\HttpHeaderNotExists
name: HTTP:Authorization
description: |
  The HTTP Authorization request header contains the credentials to authenticate
  a user agent with a server, usually after the server has responded with a
  401 Unauthorized status and the WWW-Authenticate header.

  Authorization headers can bypass page caching strategies which can detrack
  from performance.
remediation: |
  Ensure HTTP Authorization is removed before launch if it is not intended as a
  permenant part of your solution. Also ensure load testing is not carried out
  with HTTP Authorization in place as it may severly impact the results.

success: HTTP Authorization is not in use.
failure: HTTP Authorization is currently enforced.
parameters:
  header:
    default: Authorization
