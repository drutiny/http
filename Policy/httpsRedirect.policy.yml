title: "Force HTTPS"
class: \Drutiny\Http\Audit\HttpsRedirect
name: HTTP:ForceHTTPS
description: |
  Ensure attempts to http redirect the user to an HTTPS URL. This ensures no
  content is ever served over an insecure connection which is considered a best
  practice.
remediation: |
  Please ensure all requests over http are redirected to **https**. There are
  a number of ways this can be done:
    - Enforce HTTPS redirecting at the edge (WAF or CDN) if applicable.
    - Consider installing the Drupal secure pages module (Drupal 7 only)
    - Consider an apache [.htaccess rewrite rule](https://www.millwoodonline.co.uk/quicktips/enforce-ssl-drupal-8-using-redirect)

success: |
  Redirect from [{{url}}]({{url}}) to [{{location}}]({{location}}) detected.
failure: |
  A request to [{{url}}]({{url}}) did not encounter a redirect to HTTPS. The expected
  redirect should have been to [{{expected_location}}]({{expected_location}}).
