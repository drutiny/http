description: |
  X-Frame-Options tells the browser whether you want to allow your site to be
  framed or not. By preventing a browser from framing your site you can defend
  against attacks like clickjacking.
remediation: |
  There are number of methods to enable X-Frame-Options. The best option
  will depend on what best suits your project implementation:
    - Install the [Drupal seckit](https://www.drupal.org/project/seckit) module and enable X-Frame-Options.
    - If you're using an edge CDN/WAF, consult your provider to see if they support X-Frame-Options.
    - Manually manipulate your `.htaccess` file to the X-Frame-Options header.
